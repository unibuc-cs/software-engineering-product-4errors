However, she wishes for an easy-to-use, high-performing tool that can suggest films when she runs out of ideas, with recommendations that fit her unique tastes.

Now, Valentina can enjoy discovering new films weekly without contributing to the financing of unethical companies.

Even better, MovieMingle allows users to filter recommended movies by genre, ensuring they can find a family-friendly, PG-13 option.

### 💻 Alin
Alin is a third-year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, feeling stressed with his thesis and part-time corporate job.

Then, a great idea pops up: "I’ve heard about **MovieMingle!** I can just go there and see what it recommends based on my viewing history. I don’t have to waste time searching or risk picking a film I won’t like. And if I’m in the mood for something unusual, I can let it surprise me with a completely random movie!" Thanks to MovieMingle, Alin’s evening is saved, bringing him a moment of calm along with a hot coffee and cheesy, salted popcorn.

## 🛡️ Security Analysis 
MovieMingle implements **Spring Security** for authentication, supporting both **email/password login** and **OAuth2 (Google)**. Password reset is secured via **token-based validation**. This analysis aligns with **OWASP Top 10** security risks, identifying key risks and recommending improvements to enhance overall system security.

---

### 🔑 Password Security  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- Uses **BCrypt hashing** for strong password protection.  
- Password validation enforces **regular expressions** to prevent weak passwords.  

⚡ **Improvements:**  
- Set **BCrypt cost factor to 12+** to enhance brute-force resistance.  
- Implement a **password policy validator** enforcing stricter password complexity.  

---

### 📧 Email Verification Tokens  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- Email verification is required before account activation.  
- Tokens are **single-use** and **auto-deleted upon verification**.  

⚡ **Improvements:**  
- **Schedule clean-up of expired tokens** to optimize database performance.  
- **Enforce token expiration** (e.g., **24 hours**) to limit prolonged access.  

---

### 🔄 Password Reset Mechanism Security  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- Password reset is **token-based** and secured via email verification.  
- Reset tokens are **deleted immediately after use**, preventing reuse.  

⚡ **Improvements:**  
- **Set token expiration** (e.g., **30 min**) to mitigate unauthorized use.  
- **Ensure only one active reset token per user** at any time.  

---

### 🌐 OAuth2 Authentication (Google)  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- OAuth2 login is integrated, ensuring a seamless authentication process.  
- The application **extracts and verifies the user's email** as a unique identifier.  

⚠ **Observations:**  
- Authentication **fails** if the OAuth2 provider **does not return an email**.  

⚡ **Improvements:**  
- Add **fallback handling** for cases where an email attribute is missing.  

---

### 🛑 CSRF Protection  
✔ **Strength:** **CSRF is enabled** for user authentication and account-related actions. 

---


### 🚧 Brute Force Protection  
⚠ **Observations:**  
- No **rate limiting** for login attempts, making the system vulnerable to brute force attacks.  
- No **temporary account lockout mechanism** for repeated authentication failures.  

🔒 **Recommendations:**  
- Implement **rate limiting** (e.g., **5 attempts per 10 sec**) and **temporary account lockout** after multiple failures.  
- Introduce a **captcha challenge** (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA) for flagged login attempts.  

---

### 🔑 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
⚠ **Observation:**  
- **No Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is currently implemented, meaning all authenticated users have the same access level.  

🔒 **Recommendations:**  
- Introduce **RBAC** to restrict access to administrative or privileged functionalities.  
- Define **user roles** such as `USER`, `ADMIN`, and potentially `MODERATOR` to enforce **least privilege principles**.  
- Implement **Spring Security role-based authorization** to control access to specific endpoints.  

---
 

### 🔐 API Security  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- API endpoints that modify user data require authentication.  

⚠ **Observations:**  
- **All TMDb API endpoints are publicly accessible**, increasing exposure.  
- **No rate limiting on public API requests**, making them vulnerable to excessive usage.  

🔒 **Recommendations:**  
- Apply **rate limiting** on public endpoints to prevent abuse.  
- Implement **IP-based throttling** for frequently requested APIs. 

---

### 🚨 Denial of Service (DoS) Protection  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- Uses efficient API design to handle multiple requests.  

⚠ **Observations:**  
- **No request rate limiting** on login and token generation endpoints.  
- **Excessive API calls** could degrade performance.  

🔒 **Recommendations:**  
- Implement **IP-based request limiting** to prevent abusive behavior.  
- Introduce **caching mechanisms** for frequently requested responses.  
- Monitor **high request spikes** to detect potential DoS attacks.


---
### 🔐 SQL Injection Protection  
✔ **Strengths:**  
- **Hibernate (JPA)** is used for database interactions, which **prevents SQL Injection** by utilizing **prepared statements** internally.  
- Queries are executed using **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)**, ensuring safe query execution without direct SQL manipulation.  
- No **native queries** are used, eliminating risks from manual string concatenation in database queries.  

⚠ **Potential Risks:**  
- While Hibernate prevents direct SQL Injection, **improper query construction** (e.g., dynamic query building with concatenation in JPQL) could still pose a risk.

---
### 🔒 HTTPS Enforcement  
⚠ **Observations:**  
- The application currently runs on **localhost**, so HTTPS enforcement is not required in development stage.  

🔒 **Recommendations for Production Deployment:**  
- Ensure **HTTPS is enforced** for all external requests when deploying to a live environment.  
---

## 🚀 CI/CD
